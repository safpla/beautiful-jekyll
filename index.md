## **Work Experience**
### **Deeplycurious.ai, Beijing**, 09/2017 - 02/2018
*Algorithm Engineer in Natural Language Processing (NLP) team*
* Designed an attention based sequence labeling model, which achieves state-of-the-art results on NER taskon benchmart dataset, reducing the inference time of companyâ€™s online service product by 90%.
* Proposed a deep architecture with paragraph reasoning modules for document classification, which takesadvantage of both symbolic reasoning and deep nerual nets.

## **Research Project**
### **Protein sequence alignment via deep learning and reasoning**, 02/2020 - present
*Georgia Tech*, Advisor: **Prof. Le Song**
* Designed a deep architecture for protein sequence alignment problem to incorporate prior knowledge via adifferentiable reasoning layer, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark dataset.
* The model is highly structured and performs well in case of small data, which is an important propertyfor solving biological problems.

### **Learning two-time-scale user model for recommendation system**, 02/2020 - present
*Georgia Tech (joint project with Facebook AI, Personalization Team)*, Advisor: **Prof. Le Song**
* By modeling active and inactive users in different ways, the overall hybrid user model is simple yet effective,achieving at least 7% improvement on two largest benchmark datasets.
* This hybrid model tackles the challenges of bothlong-rangesequence modeling for active users, and thecold-startproblem for inactive or new users jointly.

### **Meta Learning: learning of dynamic learning schedule**, 03/2018 - 07/2018
*Carnegie Mellon University*, Advisor: **Prof. Eric Xing**
* Proposed a meta-learning framework, which provides a generic way to learn the discrete optimizationschedule from metadata, allowing for a dynamic learning schedule in ML problems. Accepted by ***[ICLR2019]***.

### **Auditory signal segmentation and classification via deep learning**, 08/2016 - 05/2017
*Johns Hopkins University*, Advisor: **Prof. Xiaoqin Wang**
* Designed a deep architecture for marmoset vocalization segmentation and classification working underhigh signal-to-noise ratio condition, which improves the detection F1-score by 50%.
* The earliest work to apply deep learning to animal vocalization detection.

### **Single photon simulation of Intrinsic Imaging system**, 08/2016 - 05/2017
*Johns Hopkins University*, Advisor: **Prof. Xiaoqin Wang**
* Built a single photon simulation model in C++ and conducted simulation experiments to model thepropagation of polarized photon in brain tissue.
* Experimental results showed that polarized photon can improve imaging depth, which guided the buildingof an intrinsic imaging system.

## **Education**:
I am currently a Master student in CS&E in Georgia Tech, working with Prof. Le Song. I completed my bachelor degree in [Tsinghua] University in 2017. See more about my research in the [Projects] page.
