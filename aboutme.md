title: About me
---

I'm currently in my gap year and looking for a short-term job or intern opportunity for the following year (2018.8-2019.08)

**Research Interests**:
Reinforcement Learning, Meta-Learning, Curriculum Learning, Multi-task Learning, Sequential Decision Making, Graphical Models, Interpretable ML. Applications in healthcare, biology, medicine, natural language and general AI.

**Research Experience**
> **Research Intern**, [SAILING LAB], Carnegie Mellon University, 2018.3-. Advisor: Prof. Eric Xing.

> I proposed a meta-learning framework, _AutoLoss_, that automatically learns and determines the schedule of optimization processes, which can improve the convergence quality of many tasks such as GAN, multi-task learning and curriculum learning. [See more][proj-autoloss].

> **Algorithm Engineer**, [deeplycurious.ai], Beijing, 2017.9-2018.2

> I developed an attention based sequence labeling model and applied it to a Named Entity Recognition task. [See more][proj-t2t].

> I designed a reasoning module to handle the feature confliction problem in document classification tasks and applied hierarchical supervision to exploit label information of different granularities. [See more][proj-focus].

**Education**:
I completed my bachelor degree in [Tsinghua] University in 2017. In my thesis, I developed and applied deep machine learning methods to biomedical applications. See more about my research in the [Projects] page.
